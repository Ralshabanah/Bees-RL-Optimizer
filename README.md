# QBSO-FS : a Reinforcement Learning based Bee Swarm Optimization metaheuristic for Feature Selection

This is the official Python implementation of the paper:

*QBSO-FS : a Reinforcement Learning based Bee Swarm Optimization metaheuristic for Feature Selection* <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20518-8_65>



## Running the code

To run the code, just go to `main.py`. For now, only KNN is implemented, but you can add your own classifier in `fs_problem.py` file.
